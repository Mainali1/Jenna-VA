## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (latest version)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mainali1/Jenna-VA.git
   cd Jenna-VA
   ```

2. Set up Python environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   cd ..
   ```

4. Configure environment:
   ```bash
   copy .env.template .env  # On Windows
   cp .env.template .env  # On macOS/Linux
   # Edit .env with your API keys and preferences
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration

All settings are managed through the `.env` file. See [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) for detailed configuration options.

## Deployment

For production deployment, you can build a standalone executable:

```bash
python build.py --release
```

This creates a complete installer in the `dist/` directory.

## Maintenance

### Cleaning the Codebase

To remove redundant files, development artifacts, and temporary files:

```bash
python cleanup.py  # Remove all redundant files
python cleanup.py --dry-run  # Show what would be removed without deleting
python cleanup.py --cache  # Remove only Python cache files
```

See `python cleanup.py --help` for more options.

## Security

- All sensitive data is stored locally by default
- API keys are stored in the `.env` file (not committed to version control)
- Communication with external services uses HTTPS

## UI Design

The UI is designed with a focus on:

- **Accessibility**: Clear contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Responsiveness**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Consistency**: Uniform design language throughout the application
- **Simplicity**: Intuitive interface with minimal learning curve
